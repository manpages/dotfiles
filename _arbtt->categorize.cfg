-- Comments in this file use the Haskell syntax:
-- A "--" comments the rest of the line.
-- A set of {- ... -} comments out a group of lines.

-- This defines some aliases, to make the reports look nicer:
aliases (
	"sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer"  -> "java",
	"sun-awt-X11-XDialogPeer" -> "java",
	"sun-awt-X11-XWindowPeer" -> "java",
	"gramps.py"               -> "gramps",
	"___nforschung"           -> "ahnenforschung",
	"Pidgin"                  -> "pidgin"
	)

-- A rule that probably everybody wants. Being inactive for over a minute
-- causes this sample to be ignored by default.
$idle > 120 && (! ($desktop =~ /.*media.*/)) ==> tag inactive,

-- Simple rule that just tags the current program
tag Program:$current.program,

-- Another simple rule, just tags the current desktop (a.k.a. workspace)
tag Desktop:$desktop,

-- To be able to match on the time of day, I introduce tags for that as well.
-- $time evaluates to local time.
$time >=  2:00 && $time <  8:00 ==> tag time-of-day:night,
$time >=  8:00 && $time < 12:00 ==> tag time-of-day:morning,
$time >= 12:00 && $time < 14:00 ==> tag time-of-day:lunchtime,
$time >= 14:00 && $time < 18:00 ==> tag time-of-day:afternoon,
$time >= 18:00 && $time < 22:00 ==> tag time-of-day:evening,
$time >= 22:00 || $time <  2:00 ==> tag time-of-day:late-evening,
